# STM32F446_SineWave_DAC_ADC_Ex01
Generating of a sinusoidal signal using a DAC, in parallel with ADC conversions, and in the last a UART transfer when triggered..


This project is very similar with the example shown in STM32F103_SineWave_ADC_DMA_Ex03 repository.

Now, i´m using a different board. Here, i´m going to use  the Nucleo F466RE. This board has a DAC, which turn easy the things. 

To create the sinusoidal wave and control the correct time of the ADC conversions i´ve used the Timer 8. Furthermore, i´ve used a look up table where the values of the sine wave were stored.  

The timer 8 counts from 0 to 250. When the counter match 70, the ADC conversion by DMA is triggered. The conversion is done and the result is sent to a buffer called AdcRead[ ]. (Peripheral -> Memory)

When the counter overflows (match 250) the DAC is triggered. At this moment, The next value of look up table is sent from the memory to peripheral DAC.
The buffer where is stored the sine look up table in the memory is called seno[ ]. (Memory -> Peripheral)


The next images shown the configuration done in STMCubeIDE.

Obs: The value of the field pulse is 70. I don´t know why, but the image is not updated.

5. UART Configuration

The sinewave created has 255 points. Each point receive a value that range from 0 to 4095. i,e the resolution of DAC is 12 bits.

To calculate the frequency of the signal generated, we can use the following formula:

![formule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114233216/195803894-29d1b247-68d2-41c8-8bb0-81189200b04e.png)

In our code we use: Fckl = 120 MHz; ARR = 254; Ns = 256;

Applying this values on the formula we find a frequency of 1838 Hz. The figure below shows the result obtained in oscilloscope. The value calculated by oscilloscope varied between 1,83KHz and 1,84KHz.

To comprove that the ADC conversion was working well, i´ve read a complete period of the wave generated by DAC. The image below shows that.

The orange signal is the signal built from look up table. The green signal is the signal built from the analog reads with the ADC.
It's important note that when the values approach of the top and the bottom, the conversion shown some irregulars. Furthermore, it´is important comment too about the difference of phase between the signal generated by DAC and the signal read by the ADC. The phase difference observed was 1 sample, which represents, more or less, 1,41°. This value is fixe and constant.  

Obs: In determined part of the code, when the STM32 receive a string "next", the buffer AdcRead[ ] with the last Ns conversions is sent by UART2. In the other side, a Labview Software receives this buffer and write them in a TXT. The parte of labview can be found in the STM32F103_SineWave_ADC_DMA_Ex03 repository.
